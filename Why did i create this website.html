                <a href="#0">
                  <br>The first question that came to my mother's mind when i showed the prototype design of this website to her was -"Why? what need do you have for a website?" which led me to genuinely think why did i create this website, was it my never ending desire to tinker with and create new things or was it just because everyone said you need a website.<br>
                  The conclusion that i came to was a mix of both the reasons, i like making new things which gave me the idea of making the website and i decided to give the website a portfolio type design but with blog posts, 
                  <br>the portfolio part serves no purpose at the moment but the blog part is something im really excited about - It will show me how i have progressed as a person, a cybersecurity "enthusiast" and how<br>
                   my knowledge has grown over the years, this will be the primary purpose of this website for now, 
                   <br>i'll hopefully be uploading 3 blog posts a week :- <br>
                  a.	The first one will be a weekly cyber security recap covering all the major cybersecurity breaches and updates in the cybersecurity world that happened during that week
                  <br>b.	The second one will be a personal weekly cyber security progress report which will be more personal and will help me track my process and hopefully will help some other beginners as well<br>
                  c.	The third one will be going into detail about any major cybersecurity breach that interests me and will hopefully give us all some blue teaming as well as red teaming tips <br>
